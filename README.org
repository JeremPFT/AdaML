#+TITLE: AdaML

* ChangeLog
** alpha version
Work in progress version. Keep tuned.

* Introduction
** What is AdaML?
- UML tailored for Ada 2012 programming language
- A modeling language to draw UML diagrams, implemented in PlantUML
- An easy way to learn Ada through the use of UML and OOP concepts

** Features
- UML tailored to use and show particular Ada language characteristics
- Coherent set of functions to design software components for Ada
- Generates high quality drawings (ps, eps) easy to embedded in other docs
- Easy to learn by example, both AdaML and Ada language

** What is /not/ AdaML?
- A model-based tool to generate Ada code
- A reverse engineering tool to draw UML diagrams from Ada code
- An interactive UML modeling or drawing tool

** Requirements
- [[https://plantuml.com][PlantUML]] installed and working in your system
- The AdaML files, check [[https://github.com/rocher/AdaML][AdaML]] installation instructions
- Your favorite text editor, preferably with PlantUML support (e.g. Emacs)
- Check the list of [[http://plantuml.com/running][supported editors]]
- For better visualization and integration with \LaTeX, [[https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern][computer modern]] fonts

** Limitations
Make sure that the PlantUML environment you're using

- lets you use external files, not only a single piece of text
- the line ~"!include AdaML.puml"~ on top of your new files effectively includes
  the AdaML.puml file
- Still under development; feedback appreciated
